this is what i want the game to do and we can look at it and see how possible it is.
In the beginning this is just going to be a dumb little car choice game but i want to try doing tuning as well after (possibly add engine noises)

car png with a choice list on the top left -> you chose parts and it ll appear as a png on the car



later : 
  try to host the website
  try to put a money system (for expl : click on a button 100 times to get 100 quid + maybe autoclicker prevention for maximum pain + as a joke dlc/codes that give you more money)
  tuning system (bad tuning makes weird engine noise and maybe a timer -> if you run it too long with bad tuning it explodes)
